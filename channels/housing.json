Here's my general review:\n\nBuildings on TI are older, neighborhoods are OK, not really sketchy by any means, but not like... nice. There's a grocery store and a little convenience store shack thingy and that's about it. One upside is there's a lot of street parking, one downside is that you cannot get to the city without taking the bus/driving a vehicle. The bus comes \"every\" 15 during the day and \"every\" 30 at night, 24/7, but I've had to wait an hour for it to show up before. Traffic on the bridge blows almost 24/7.\n\nKinda big caveat: the buildings are all on a list for being removed, so you might one day get 30 days notice to leave so they can bulldoze your house. Chances are this won't happen for a couple years. \n\n...also there's high levels of radiation and heavy metal poisoning in the soil which is why there's a bunch of houses that got boarded up &amp;&amp; fenced off and have gigantic warning signs. Like I've had government dudes with geiger counters in my lawn."
