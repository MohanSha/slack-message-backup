Right now I have a half-finished iOS app called \"U.S. History Hunter\" (it's on my repo). \nI've taken a spreadsheet from the official Registered U.S. Landmarks site and parsed all the information into JSON. Then I used a tool that returns all coordinates of those landmarks and linked them up with X-Code's map-view API. What we can do is put the information on a server instead of having it local in the compiled program. And then create an automation to update the info on the server when're there a change. That way whenever it updates we can have it push the information to the mobile app as well as a web application. \nThoughts?"
